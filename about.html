            <h1>What is this about?</h1>
            <p>
                This is a course page for CodeLab, a student-run programming club.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>What is CodeLab?</h2>
            <p>
                CodeLab is a voluntary extracurricular programming club, primarily targeting linguists from the UPOL General LinguisticsDdepartment, welcomming both programming beginners, intermediates, and seasoned programmers.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The main goal was to gather people from our department that crave a community with similar background and are not afraid of challenges. Sometimes classes are a struggle or don't have the time to go into depth.
                CodeLab was started to fill some of those gaps and help students apply their knowledge through fun group-based projects, as well as diving deeper into some areas classes did not manage to cover.
                We aim to broaden our knowledge, share experiences, and help each other out with challenging homework.<br>
                <br>
                This semester, we will be focusing on expanding our skills in <em>data science</em>, <em>databases</em>, <em>cybersecurity</em> and <em>NLP</em> — areas whose understanding is proving to be crucial in the current AI-infested digital landscape. <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The project has been a free-time endeavour, put together through pure love of the craft and also our department. 
                It is currently being run by me and my friend <a href="https://github.com/RumouredSoup">Anne</a>. However, neither of us is a programming professional, nor has much hands-on experience within the IT industry. 
                Our intention was not to be teachers but merely to provide some space and occasional guidance.
                We are also learners right here, alongside you, and we hope that your journey with us will be fun (and hopefully useful).<br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                If you are studying linguistics at Palacký University and would like to join us, connect with us through <a href="https://discord.gg/ywKZFC8gR7">our Discord</a>.
